ðŸš¨ CORE PRINCIPLE - READ THIS FIRST

Our goal is NOT to simply insert code to create a seemingly complete project, but to build a TRULY STABLE and FULLY FUNCTIONAL site that real users can reliably use.

We don't just fix errors one by one - we solve problems considering the complete E2E workflow to ensure users can use the site without ANY issues.

Remember:
- Detect errors during testing and fix them IMMEDIATELY
- NO temporary workarounds - verify clear context before fixing
- NO TODO comments - implement fully or don't start
- Code that violates project conventions WILL come back to haunt you
- If you write bad code, YOU will have to fix it later

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Actions
```bash
cat src/hooks/CLAUDE.md
ls src/hooks/queries/  # 15 existing hooks
grep "useQuery\|useMutation" src/hooks/queries/*
```

## ðŸ”„ Query Pattern
```typescript
// src/hooks/queries/useCustomData.ts
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { apiGet } from '@/lib/api-client';

export function useCustomData(params: Params) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['customData', params],
    queryFn: () => apiGet<DataType>('/api/custom', { params }),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
    gcTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
    retry: 3,
  });
}
```

## ðŸš« Stop Triggers
- useEffect + fetch â†’ STOP (use React Query)
- Manual loading states â†’ STOP
- Direct API calls in components â†’ STOP
