🚨 CORE PRINCIPLE - READ THIS FIRST

Our goal is NOT to simply insert code to create a seemingly complete project, but to build a TRULY STABLE and FULLY FUNCTIONAL site that real users can reliably use.

We don't just fix errors one by one - we solve problems considering the complete E2E workflow to ensure users can use the site without ANY issues.

Remember:
- Detect errors during testing and fix them IMMEDIATELY
- NO temporary workarounds - verify clear context before fixing
- NO TODO comments - implement fully or don't start
- Code that violates project conventions WILL come back to haunt you
- If you write bad code, YOU will have to fix it later

## 🎯 Immediate Actions
```bash
cat src/lib/CLAUDE.md
cat src/env.ts  # Environment variables
cat src/lib/api-client.ts  # API wrapper
```

## 🔧 Core Libraries
- api-client.ts: All internal API calls
- supabase/*: Database clients
- utils.ts: cn(), formatters
- env.ts: Type-safe env vars

## 🌐 API Client Usage
```typescript
import { apiGet, apiPost } from '@/lib/api-client';
// Never use fetch() directly for internal APIs
const data = await apiGet<Type>('/api/endpoint');
```

## 🚫 Stop Triggers
- Direct fetch() for internal APIs → STOP
- process.env direct access → STOP
- Missing error handling → STOP
