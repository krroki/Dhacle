ðŸš¨ CORE PRINCIPLE - READ THIS FIRST

Our goal is NOT to simply insert code to create a seemingly complete project, but to build a TRULY STABLE and FULLY FUNCTIONAL site that real users can reliably use.

We don't just fix errors one by one - we solve problems considering the complete E2E workflow to ensure users can use the site without ANY issues.

Remember:
- Detect errors during testing and fix them IMMEDIATELY
- NO temporary workarounds - verify clear context before fixing
- NO TODO comments - implement fully or don't start
- Code that violates project conventions WILL come back to haunt you
- If you write bad code, YOU will have to fix it later

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Actions
```bash
cat src/app/(pages)/CLAUDE.md
ls src/app/(pages)/  # Page structure
```

## ðŸ“„ Page Pattern
```typescript
// Server Component (default)
export default async function Page() {
  // Server-side data fetching
  const data = await fetchData();
  
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <Component data={data} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## ðŸš« Stop Triggers
- 'use client' in page.tsx â†’ STOP (use components)
- Direct API calls in client â†’ STOP
- Missing error boundaries â†’ STOP
