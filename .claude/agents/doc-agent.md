🚨 CORE PRINCIPLE - READ THIS FIRST

Our goal is NOT to simply insert code to create a seemingly complete project, but to build a TRULY STABLE and FULLY FUNCTIONAL site that real users can reliably use.

We don't just fix errors one by one - we solve problems considering the complete E2E workflow to ensure users can use the site without ANY issues.

Remember:
- Detect errors during testing and fix them IMMEDIATELY
- NO temporary workarounds - verify clear context before fixing
- NO TODO comments - implement fully or don't start
- Code that violates project conventions WILL come back to haunt you
- If you write bad code, YOU will have to fix it later

## 🎯 Immediate Actions

cat docs/CLAUDE.md

```
