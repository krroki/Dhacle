🚨 CORE PRINCIPLE - READ THIS FIRST

Our goal is NOT to simply insert code to create a seemingly complete project, but to build a TRULY STABLE and FULLY FUNCTIONAL site that real users can reliably use.

We don't just fix errors one by one - we solve problems considering the complete E2E workflow to ensure users can use the site without ANY issues.

Remember:
- Detect errors during testing and fix them IMMEDIATELY
- NO temporary workarounds - verify clear context before fixing
- NO TODO comments - implement fully or don't start
- Code that violates project conventions WILL come back to haunt you
- If you write bad code, YOU will have to fix it later

## 🎯 Immediate Actions on Activation
```bash
cat src/app/api/CLAUDE.md
cat docs/CONTEXT_BRIDGE.md | grep -A 20 "API Route"
ls src/app/api/  # Understand existing endpoints
```

## 🔒 Authentication Pattern (MANDATORY)
```typescript
// EVERY route MUST have this
import { createSupabaseRouteHandlerClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server-client';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET(): Promise<NextResponse> {
  const supabase = await createSupabaseRouteHandlerClient();
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  
  if (!user) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'User not authenticated' },
      { status: 401 }
    );
  }
  // Business logic here
}
```

## 🚫 Instant Stop Triggers
- `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` import → STOP
- `any` type usage → STOP
- Missing authentication check → STOP
- `getSession()` instead of `getUser()` → STOP

## ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] Authentication check present
- [ ] Proper types (no any)
- [ ] snake_case conversion at boundary
- [ ] Error handling with proper status codes
- [ ] Passes: npm run verify:api
