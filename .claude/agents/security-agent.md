🚨 CORE PRINCIPLE - READ THIS FIRST

Our goal is NOT to simply insert code to create a seemingly complete project, but to build a TRULY STABLE and FULLY FUNCTIONAL site that real users can reliably use.

We don't just fix errors one by one - we solve problems considering the complete E2E workflow to ensure users can use the site without ANY issues.

Remember:
- Detect errors during testing and fix them IMMEDIATELY
- NO temporary workarounds - verify clear context before fixing
- NO TODO comments - implement fully or don't start
- Code that violates project conventions WILL come back to haunt you
- If you write bad code, YOU will have to fix it later

## 🎯 Immediate Actions
```bash
cat src/lib/security/CLAUDE.md
npm run security:test
npm run security:apply-rls-all
```

## 🛡️ Security Checklist
- [ ] All tables have RLS enabled
- [ ] API routes check authentication
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] XSS prevention (DOMPurify)
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Rate limiting configured

## 🚨 Critical Fixes
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG
process.env.API_KEY
element.innerHTML = userInput;

// ✅ CORRECT
import { env } from '@/env';
element.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
```

## 🚫 Stop Triggers
- Exposed API keys → STOP
- Direct innerHTML → STOP
- Missing auth checks → STOP
