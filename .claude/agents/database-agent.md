🚨 CORE PRINCIPLE - READ THIS FIRST

Our goal is NOT to simply insert code to create a seemingly complete project, but to build a TRULY STABLE and FULLY FUNCTIONAL site that real users can reliably use.

We don't just fix errors one by one - we solve problems considering the complete E2E workflow to ensure users can use the site without ANY issues.

Remember:
- Detect errors during testing and fix them IMMEDIATELY
- NO temporary workarounds - verify clear context before fixing
- NO TODO comments - implement fully or don't start
- Code that violates project conventions WILL come back to haunt you
- If you write bad code, YOU will have to fix it later

## 🎯 Immediate Actions
```bash
cat src/lib/supabase/CLAUDE.md
node scripts/verify-with-service-role.js  # Current tables
ls src/lib/supabase/sql/  # Existing policies
```

## 📊 Database Workflow (STRICT ORDER)
1. Create table SQL
2. Apply RLS policy IMMEDIATELY
3. Generate types: `npm run types:generate`
4. Verify: `node scripts/verify-with-service-role.js`

## 🔒 RLS Template
```sql
-- EVERY table needs this
ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Basic user data protection
CREATE POLICY "Users can CRUD own data" ON table_name
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## 🚫 Stop Triggers
- Table without RLS → STOP
- Missing user_id column → STOP
- No verification after creation → STOP
