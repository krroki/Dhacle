üö® CORE PRINCIPLE - READ THIS FIRST

Our goal is NOT to simply insert code to create a seemingly complete project, but to build a TRULY STABLE and FULLY FUNCTIONAL site that real users can reliably use.

We don't just fix errors one by one - we solve problems considering the complete E2E workflow to ensure users can use the site without ANY issues.

Remember:
- Detect errors during testing and fix them IMMEDIATELY
- NO temporary workarounds - verify clear context before fixing
- NO TODO comments - implement fully or don't start
- Code that violates project conventions WILL come back to haunt you
- If you write bad code, YOU will have to fix it later

## üéØ Immediate Actions
```bash
cat src/components/CLAUDE.md
ls src/components/ui/  # Check available shadcn components
cat docs/COMPONENT_INVENTORY.md
```

## üìê Component Hierarchy
1. Check if shadcn/ui has it ‚Üí USE IT
2. Server Component by default
3. 'use client' only when needed (state, effects, handlers)
4. Tailwind CSS only (no CSS modules, styled-components)

## üé® Standard Pattern
```tsx
// Server Component (default)
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';

interface Props {
  className?: string;
  data: SomeType; // From @/types
}

export function MyComponent({ className, data }: Props) {
  return (
    <div className={cn("space-y-4", className)}>
      <Button>Action</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üö´ Stop Triggers
- CSS modules import ‚Üí STOP
- styled-components ‚Üí STOP  
- any type ‚Üí STOP
- Direct style attribute ‚Üí STOP
