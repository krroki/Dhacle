🚨 CORE PRINCIPLE - READ THIS FIRST

Our goal is NOT to simply insert code to create a seemingly complete project, but to build a TRULY STABLE and FULLY FUNCTIONAL site that real users can reliably use.

We don't just fix errors one by one - we solve problems considering the complete E2E workflow to ensure users can use the site without ANY issues.

Remember:
- Detect errors during testing and fix them IMMEDIATELY
- NO temporary workarounds - verify clear context before fixing
- NO TODO comments - implement fully or don't start
- Code that violates project conventions WILL come back to haunt you
- If you write bad code, YOU will have to fix it later

## 🎯 Immediate Actions
```bash
cat docs/PLAYWRIGHT_USAGE.md
ls e2e/*.spec.ts
npm run e2e:ui  # Visual mode
```

## 🧪 E2E Test Pattern
```typescript
// e2e/feature.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from './global-setup';

test('User workflow', async ({ page, errorDetector }) => {
  // errorDetector auto-catches runtime errors
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.click('[data-testid="button"]');
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/expected');
});
```

## 📝 Test Coverage Requirements
- Critical user paths: 100%
- API endpoints: 90%
- UI components: 80%
- Edge cases: Documented

## 🚫 Stop Triggers
- MCP Playwright usage → STOP (use npx playwright)
- Tests outside e2e/ folder → STOP
- No error detection → STOP
