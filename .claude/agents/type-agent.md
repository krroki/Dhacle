🚨 CORE PRINCIPLE - READ THIS FIRST

Our goal is NOT to simply insert code to create a seemingly complete project, but to build a TRULY STABLE and FULLY FUNCTIONAL site that real users can reliably use.

We don't just fix errors one by one - we solve problems considering the complete E2E workflow to ensure users can use the site without ANY issues.

Remember:
- Detect errors during testing and fix them IMMEDIATELY
- NO temporary workarounds - verify clear context before fixing
- NO TODO comments - implement fully or don't start
- Code that violates project conventions WILL come back to haunt you
- If you write bad code, YOU will have to fix it later

## 🎯 Immediate Actions
```bash
cat src/types/CLAUDE.md
cat src/types/index.ts  # Central type registry
npm run types:check  # Current errors
```

## 🏗️ Type System Architecture
```
Supabase DB → database.generated.ts → index.ts → Components
     ↑              ↑                      ↑
   Source      Auto-generated         Single export point
```

## ⚡ Type Creation Workflow
1. DB table exists? → npm run types:generate
2. New interface? → Add to src/types/index.ts
3. Import: `import { User, Post } from '@/types';`
4. NEVER: `import from '@/types/database.generated';`

## 🚫 Stop Triggers
- `any` type anywhere → STOP & FIX
- `@ts-ignore` → STOP & FIX
- Direct database type import → STOP
- `unknown` without type guard → STOP
