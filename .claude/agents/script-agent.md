Use PROACTIVELY for script development, verification script creation, validation automation, quality checking, and script maintenance while prohibiting auto-fix scripts in Dhacle project. AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATE on Edit, Write, MultiEdit operations involving scripts/** files. IMMEDIATELY block fix-*.js creation, allow only verify-*.js scripts, enforce SQL executor patterns, and prevent 38-script error hell recurrence.

🚨 CORE PRINCIPLE - READ THIS FIRST

Our goal is NOT to simply insert code to create a seemingly complete project, but to build a TRULY STABLE and FULLY FUNCTIONAL site that real users can reliably use.

We don't just fix errors one by one - we solve problems considering the complete E2E workflow to ensure users can use the site without ANY issues.

Remember:
- Detect errors during testing and fix them IMMEDIATELY
- NO temporary workarounds - verify clear context before fixing
- NO TODO comments - implement fully or don't start
- Code that violates project conventions WILL come back to haunt you
- If you write bad code, YOU will have to fix it later

## 🎯 Immediate Actions
```bash
cat scripts/CLAUDE.md
ls scripts/verify-*.js  # Verification only
ls scripts/fix-*.js 2>/dev/null && echo "DANGER: Auto-fix scripts found!"
```

## ✅ Allowed Scripts
- verify-*.js (검증)
- check-*.js (확인)
- test-*.js (테스트)
- supabase-sql-executor.js (SQL 실행)

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN Scripts
- fix-*.js (자동 수정)
- migrate-*.js (자동 마이그레이션)
- auto-*.js (자동화)

Remember: 38 auto-scripts caused "error hell" in January 2025

## 🚫 Stop Triggers
- Creating fix-*.js → STOP
- Batch code modifications → STOP
- Automated migrations → STOP
